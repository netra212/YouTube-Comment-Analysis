### Problem Statement

## Business Context:
We are "Influence Boost Inc.," an influencer management company seeking to expand our
network by attracting more influencers to join our platform. Due to a limited marketing
budget, traditional advertising channels are not viable for us. To overcome this, we aim to
offer a solution that addresses a significant pain point for influencers, thereby encouraging
them to engage with our company.

## Business Problem:
1. Need to Attract More Influencers:
    Objective: Increase our influencer clientele to enhance our service offerings to brands and stay competitive.
    Challenge: Limited marketing budget restricts our ability to reach and engage potential influencer clients through conventional means.

2. Identifying the Influencer Pain Point:
    Understanding Influencer Challenges: To effectively attract influencers, we need to understand and address the key challenges they face.
    Research Insight: Influencers, especially those with large followings, struggle with managing and interpreting the vast amount of feedback they receive via comments on their content.

3. Big Influencers Face Issues with Comment Analysis:
    Volume of Comments: High-profile influencers receive thousands of comments on their videos, making manual analysis impractical.
    Time Constraints: Influencers often lack the time to sift through comments to extract meaningful insights.
    Impact on Content Strategy: Without efficient comment analysis, influencers miss opportunities to understand audience sentiment, address concerns, and tailor their content effectively.
